## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **Generative AI** project that demonstrates how to convert natural language prompts into high-quality images using:

- ✨ **Stable Diffusion XL Base 1.0** — A powerful latent text-to-image diffusion model
- 🧠 **Large Language Models (LLMs)** — Used under the hood to understand and encode text prompts
- 🌍 **Hugging Face Inference API** — Provides access to hosted models
- 🐍 **Flask (Python)** — Lightweight backend web framework
- ☁️ **Render** — Free cloud hosting for web apps

Whether you're building a creative tool, an AI art generator, or experimenting with multimodal AI, this project gives you a fast and deployable foundation.
