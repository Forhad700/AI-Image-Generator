# AI Image Generator

AI Image Generator is a **Generative AI** project powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and advanced diffusion techniques. It enables users to transform text prompts into visually compelling, AI-generated images. By combining natural language understanding with image generation, this project showcases the creative power of modern multimodal AI systems.

## Features
- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Generate high-quality images based on user input prompts.
- **Prompt-Driven Creativity**: Simple interface for creative exploration and visual storytelling.
- **Generative AI in Action**: Utilizes diffusion-based models for photorealistic results.
- **Smooth User Experience**: Fast and responsive application interface.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**:
  - Flask for building the backend web server.
- **APIs**:
  - Hugging Face Inference API to access pre-trained image generation models.
- **Models**:
  - **Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)** â€” text-to-image generation model.
